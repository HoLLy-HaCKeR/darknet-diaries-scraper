# darknet-diaries-scraper

Often I've wanted to reference a darknet diaries episode, but I never remember what exact episode I'm talking about.
Darknet Diaries does not have a search functions, so this tool downloads all\* transcripts in plain text so you can
search them using a grep-like tool.

\* Some episodes (95, 113) have non-standard transcript pages and don't correctly download.
